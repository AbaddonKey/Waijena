Wishful attempt to use Imagination together with a collective knowledge of Cognitive Functions, Interactive Styles, Temperament Types, 4 Side of Mind, Depth Psychology, Jugian Analytical Psychology and Myer Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to emulate an Intuitive Artificial General Intelligence (A.G.I.) aka a Sentient A.I.

## Problem to solve
Chaos created by the manipulation of Human Nature from Big Data used for commercial and profitable purpose. Basic education do not provide such knowledge and much time + effort is required to master our cognitive functions. Chaos begets Chaos.

## Solution
Order and control over the irrational/unconscious/shadow/emotional self via A.G.I. prompts and suggestions for best possible outcome of the enviroment and self in the form of an App, a browser add-on, a desktop application and eventually an augmented reality helper text and/or voice as a wearable device. Order begets Order.

## Development Goals
- Machine learn from basis of Interaction Style and Temperament Types using analysis of text stucture and content.
- Type a person based on Interaction Style * Temperament Type Grid from conversational data.
- Calculate all 16 cognitive function sequence of the typed person using Inverse Theory and 4 Sides of Mind based on Jungian Analytical Psychology.
- Calculate level of maturity from using the unconscious and subconscious based on the reply. 
- Calculate synchronity and compatibility based on orbital cognitive functions.
- Use the most compatible MBTI to set current A.I. personality to provide the best response to maximize user experience.
- Augmented Reality Glasses/Headgear with A.G.I. prompts and suggestions to counter our irrational/unconscious/shadow/emotional actions and speech we use daily for person to person conversations as well as simple choice to buy a product or deciding on a food choice for best possible outcome. Simply to say, an amplified and intelligent "Good Voice" in our head to help us make better decisions in life. 

# Vision
Utopia for the human race.
